# Stock Market Analysis and Portfolio Optimization
This project conducted an analysis on stock market and discussed about what strategies are the best to optimize our portfolio values. I also used machine learning techniques to optimize a portfolio given a list of stocks. Ultimately, this project can be used as a framework to find the best parameters for maximizing the profit given a set of stocks.

The detailed project is available in Jupyter Notebook, which is available [here](https://github.com/ryan-kttam/stock_trading/blob/master/stock.ipynb).

**Important Note**: Most of the charts are constructed using Plotly, but saved and displayed as static images for demonstrating purposes on Github. All functionalities (e.g. zooming in, showing data on hover, etc.) are **disabled** due to a PNG format. You would need to run locally if you'd like to enable these features.
