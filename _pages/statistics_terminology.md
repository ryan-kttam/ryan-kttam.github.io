# Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a method that compares two or more data sets, or groups. There are two terminologies that one should be familiarized when referring to hypothesis testing: null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. Null hypothesis represents there are no relationships between the predictor variable and the response variable; alternative hypothesis, depending on how you set it up, can represent different meanings, but it generally means there IS relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable.
